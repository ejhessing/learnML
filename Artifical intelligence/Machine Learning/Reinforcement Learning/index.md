# Reinforcement Learning

A reinforcement learning model learns from actions it takes and rewards it receives to identify which actions lead to the best rewards.

Reinforcement learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

A reinforcement learning model learns from actions it takes and rewards it receives to identify which actions lead to the best rewards. The model is trained by trial and error, and it is not given any training data. The model is given a reward for performing a desired action and a punishment for performing an undesired action.

Reinforcement learning is characterized by a continious loop where an agent interacts with an environment and measures the consequences of its actions.
