# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on techniques used to generate a prediction or classification. The goal is to take the input data and output data, and then train an algorithm to learn the relationship between the two. The algorithm is then used to make predictions on new data.

Supervised learning is characterized by a training phase where the algorithm is trained on a set of input data and output data. The algorithm is then tested on a set of new data to determine how well it performs.

A classification model will learn to identify how input variables contribute to the output variable.
