# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a subset of machine learning that is used to better understand the distribution of the input data. Instead of training the algorithm on a set of input data and output data, the algorithm is trained on a set of input data only. The algorithm is then used to make predictions on new data.

A clustering model attempts to find groups, similarities, and relationships with unlabelled data.
