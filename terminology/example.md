# Example

## What is an example?

An example is a piece of data.
We can have labeled or unlabeled examples.

A labeled example includes both features and the label. i.e. normally used to the train the model
An unlabeled example only includes features. i.e. normally used to test the model

### For example:

When trying to predict the stock price (with only one feature, the financials)

- A labeled example would include the financials and the price of the stock.
- An unlabeled example would only include the financials.
