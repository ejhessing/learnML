# Features

## What are features?

The input variables for the things we are trying to predict. Also known as the independent variables.

## For Example

- The `x` variables in a simple linear regression.

When trying to predict a future price of a stock:

- The past price of a stock.
- The economic conditions of the country.
- The financial conditions of the company.
