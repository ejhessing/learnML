# Model

## What is the model?

The model is the thing (algorithm) that is doing the predicting. We are trying to create this model through the process of learning from data.

### For Example

When trying to predict the stock price (with only one feature, the financials)

- We would pass the model with the financial statements and the model would give us the price of the stock. This price is the prediction.
